CANanalyze : a python framework for automotive protocols

CANanalyze is a python framework to interact with normalized protocols (CAN, ISOTP, UDS) used in automotive industry. This framework was developed to help cyber security validations, run dynamic analysis or verifications on complex ECU (detect debug services, test routing and firewall calibration, interact simultaneously with automobile equipment on multiple interfaces). The framework provides an easy to use API to implement custom tests, a collection of scripts for common operations including validations on virtual or physical gateways.
